# Source Code [Placeholder]
The `src` folder this readme is a part of is a placeholder for future source code.
The name and description of this folder and file are most definitely not final.

When the time comes to upload source code, the following tasks should be completed:
- the folder name should be changed if necessary
- the README file at the root of this repo should be updated in regards to the source code section
- a format/style for how code is uploaded should be established
- this README file should be updated
