The purpose of this repo is to give structure to and organizes my self-teaching of Rust, as well as documenting my journey as useful reference for my future self and others. My self-teaching goal is to not just "learn how to write code in Rust" but to develop a deeper and more intuitive understanding of the language, as well as improving my ability to self-teach. I will attempt to achieve this by researching and setting goals of knowledge/understanding, doing examples, and documenting my process and findings.

## Journal
A big part of this self-teaching project will be documentation. Writing about what I learned should help retain that knowledge as well as helping me notice gaps in knowledge. This project includes a `journal` folder where such documentation will go. Details about the journal such as what content to include and how to organize it will go in a README file in the journal folder.

## Source Code
At some point I will likely include code snippits/examples, the temporary placeholder for this will be a folder labeled `src`. I do not expect to immidiately have code examples so I will update this when the time comes.
