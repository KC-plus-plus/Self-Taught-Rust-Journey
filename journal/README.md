# Journal
The purpose of the journal is to document what I learn along the way, it's my notes.
The notes should be organized for easy lookup and should include plenty of information about my findings.

## Writing Topic Ideas
Since I will be writing in this journal, it will be a good idea to include ideas here for what to write about.
Should I think of more ideas later, they can be added to this list:
- What did you *Learn*? If you can teach the topic to others, it shows a better understanding, as well as finding holes in your knowledge.
- What are some example *Problems & Solutions*? Solving problems and coming up with them shows the ability to apply what you've learned. These could be written response or code based.
- What is an example of *Something You Can Relate This To* that you could give? Relating something you already know to something you don't know can help make better connections in your brain and improve understanding & memory.
- What is some *Repetitive Practice* you did? Where example problems test your problem solving, repetitive practive is more about memory. Something like declaring 20 variables with different types may help with memorizing syntax and data types.

## Formatting and Layout
The layout of this folder should be consistent in order to naviagte easier.
The journal entries are expected to be written by the day, so organizing chronologically by date should be easiest.
A chronological layout is not necessarily best for someone reading this as reference material but these are notes, perhaps in the future I could consider making a different section sorted by topics?
The plan for an organized layout is to introduce folders for years should I be actively journalling for more than one year, otherwise it seems unnecessary.
Names of folders and files should be labeled such that an alphabetical sort will make them in chronological order from oldest to newest.
The files will include year names regardless of whether there are folders to sort by year.
A file for each month should do well, since it's unlikely that I will have substantial information to write about in every daily entry and I could make daily entries into headings of the month file.
