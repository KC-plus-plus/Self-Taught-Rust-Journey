## 01 Wednesday, June 1st
Day 0!... Or day 1, depending on how you count it I suppose. *[Insert witty joke about Computer Scientists being obsessed with counting from 0]*.

Coincidentally also the first day of Pride month, I feel like there's also some joke to be made about being queer and learning how to write Rust, but idk, so 
*[insert joke about trans fem person writing Rust for Pride month]*.

I put in a lot of effort to make this all structured and organzied and I hope I actually carry through and use it.
So cheers to the very first day of my learning Rust journal. I think it's a good idea to take stock of where I'm at and what's next.
Currently the repo looks ready for note taking and my current focus is going to be knocking out [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) while also writing about it.
During the spring semester I got about halfway through and then got distracted from it with school being busy.
I recently took another crack at it but I think I was just blazing through and just trying to solve the problem asap while (re)learning the minimal amount just to get by, and I don't think that's a good way to approach it.
I think I will start over on that... again. As of right now I don't think I will be posting any of my code work for Rustlings to this repo, I don't see much point.

As far as improving my self-teaching, a couple articles came up while I was internet searching that I may want to look at more in the future. Here they are: [Nat Eliason Blog](https://www.nateliason.com/blog/self-education), [Lifehack Article by Dustin Wax](https://www.lifehack.org/articles/featured/becoming-self-taught.html).

Setting up this repo I think was a good acomplishment but I think if I want to keep the ball rolling I should do at least a little bit of Rustlings today as well, that way I can start off with a good momentum.

Update: I had a big brain move called "Remembering that this is a Github repo and therefore I have access to features like issues and projects" (it's a working title). So I made an [issue tracker for completing rustlings](https://github.com/KC-plus-plus/Self-Taught-Rust-Journey/issues/1).
